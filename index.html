OBJECTIVE

Intend to become a software engineer using the technical and soft skills I developed from my work experience and education.

Non-technical: Strong organization and collaborative teamwork abilities, experience tutoring children aged 6-12

 

EXPERIENCE

iOS CODEPATH UNIVERSITY Bootcamp, Online Program Only

Student (August 2021-Present)

• Learned about iOS app development through the Codepath bootcamp.

• Developed iOS apps using XCode in the Swift language and tested them on an emulator.

CUNY TECH PREP, Online Program Only

Fellow, Data Science (July 2021 – Present)

• Learned about data science and developed projects in the Python 3 language to test my knowledge.

• Utilized the numpy and pandas libraries as well as Jupyter notebooks, and implemented concepts such as collecting and processing data, data visualization, statistical modelling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques such as logistic regression.

 

SELECTED PROJECTS

LINKED LIST FUNCTIONS, Data Structures, QUEENS COLLEGE

• Programmed functions in the Java language that allowed me to add and multiply by reading in mathematical expressions in linked-list form while accounting for order of operations, as well as functions to find the mid element of a linked list and to see if a list was looped.

             PARALLEL PROCESSING ARRAY MINIMUMS, Operating System Principles, QUEENS COLLEGE

• Created a program in the C language without using standard operations that read a 10,000-element array each from two text files, and for each file array used parallel processing, partitioning each array into 10, 1,000 element parts to be read by a function within a p-thread to find the local minimum of each part. Then in the end, it found the global minimum of each file array by comparing from an array of local minimums from the file array.

           RATIONAL NUMBER OBJECTS, Object Oriented Programming in C++, QUEENS COLLEGE

• Developed a class in the C++ language to allow the representation of a rational number object (such as 2/3 or 4/23) and programmed ostream operator functions to allow rational numbers to be used for mathematical operations; for instance, the addition operator would add two rational numbers and return a new rational number object as the sum.

 

SELECTED ACTIVITIES

           STACKS ASSISTANT (September 2018-January 2019), QUEENS LIBRARY, KEW GARDEN HILLS

• Helped run the STACKS program with duties including tutoring pre-high school students, as well as running programs intended to entertain and educate on various subjects from mathematics to language arts.

• Temporarily administered the program upon departure of my STACKS leader, planning and carrying out projects with aid of fellow staff.

DOE SYEP SUMMER RISING TEACHING ASSISTANT (July 2021-August 2021), PS 89, QUEENS

• Helped run the Summer Rising program on behalf of Queens Community House by coteaching students and organizing and carrying out student activities.
